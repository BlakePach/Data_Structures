1. Implement a function ‘displayMonth(int numDays, int startCol) that takes two integer arguments - 
number of days in the month and column where 1st day starts - and displays 7 days per line as below. 
Test the function in main() of HW1.java. Use of tab “\t” will be useful for alignment. (10 points)


2. Implement a function ‘drawHollowSquareWithSymbol(char symbol, int size)’ that takes a symbol as 
character and size as integer and draws a hollow square of the given ‘size’ using the given ‘symbol’ 
(HINT: using if-else statement in a nested-loop to check if it is on boundary would be an easy way to solve it). 
In order to have the square more accurate ratio between width and height, use an extra space ‘ ’ each time print the symbol. 
Test the function in main() of HW1.java. Following are example test code and its output. (10 points)
